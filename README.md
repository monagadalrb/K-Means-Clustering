Introduction:
K-Means Clustering is a popular algorithm for partitioning a dataset into k distinct, non-overlapping clusters.
The goal is to group data points such that points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. 
This project provides a Python implementation of the algorithm and includes visualization tools to help understand the clustering process.

Features:
- Implementation of the K-Means algorithm from scratch.
- Support for custom datasets.
- Visualization of clusters using matplotlib.
- Easy-to-use interface for clustering and evaluation.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- PIL
- matplotlib


You can install the required libraries using:
- pip install numpy matplotlib PIL
